Evaluate the truthiness of an object without getting out the logical
expressions

    true.true?                # => true
    false.true?               # => false
    "true".true?              # => false
    nil.true?                 # => false

    false.false?              # => true
    true.false?               # => false
    "false".false?            # => false
    nil.false?                # => false

    "almost anything".truthy? # => true
    false.truthy?             # => false
    nil.truthy?               # => false

NOTE: The truthy? method original came from another gem called "truthy"
but I determined that it was still the best name for that type of method
